# Hero Trainer

Hero Trainer is a game library I'm writing to learn ruby with the help of @nicolaracco (He writes the specs, I let them pass).

## Components

At the moment there are the following components:

- A Calendar (in which each year is composed by 10 months and each month by 30 days)
- A Skill composed by name and exp points. It can have a maximum of 4500 points. The skill level is calculated using the points.
- A Hero. It has a name and a set of skills

## Specs

To run the specs:

```
    bundle install
    rspec --color
```

## Contributing

If you have suggestions or you find a bug:

- open an issue

or:

- fork this repository
- write the specs that describe the features
- create a pull request

And thank you ;)
